DISCOVERY: Book data is embedded as JSON in #itemViewResponse script tag. No DOM scraping needed.
DATA AVAILABLE: asin, title, authors[], productUrl (cover), percentageRead, resourceType, originType
PAGINATION: paginationToken field indicates more data to fetch - need to investigate API
NEXT: Build extension that extracts JSON and handles pagination
