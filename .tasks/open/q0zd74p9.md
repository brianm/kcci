Audit UI components to ensure interactive elements have clear desktop-app affordances.

**Problem:**
- App uses web technologies (Svelte) but runs as a desktop app
- Web conventions (bare text links, underlined text as buttons) are non-obvious in desktop context
- Desktop users expect buttons to look like buttons

**Things to review:**
- Text that acts as buttons → should have button styling
- Clickable elements → should have hover states, cursor changes
- Action triggers → should be visually distinct from static text
- Consider macOS HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) for native feel

**Files to audit:**
- ui/src/components/*.svelte
- ui/src/routes/*.svelte
- ui/src/App.svelte

**Potential fixes:**
- Add button styling to interactive text
- Ensure consistent hover/active states
- Consider using a component library with desktop-appropriate defaults
