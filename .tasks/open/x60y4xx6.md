Phase 1: Chrome extension to scrape Kindle library (JS)
Phase 2: Python backend - import, enrich via APIs, embeddings, SQLite storage  
Phase 3: Local web UI for search

Decisions made:
- Python for backend (may rewrite to Rust later)
- Local embedding models (adding books is infrequent)
- SQLite with FTS5 + vector search
- All past code/decisions are negotiable
