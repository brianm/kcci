Revisit in 3-6 months (created Dec 2025, revisit Jun-Sep 2026).

## Problem
OpenLibrary often lacks descriptions for indie/self-published books (e.g., "Bear That Fell From The Stars" by Keith Blackmore). Need a fallback source for book descriptions.

## What We Researched (Dec 2025)

### APIs with no indie coverage
- Google Books API - no results for test book
- Library of Congress API - no results
- Internet Archive - no results
- BookBrainz - no results
- Hardcover - no results

### APIs with data but unusable
- Goodreads - has data, shut down API in 2020
- Amazon PA-API - has data, requires affiliate site with public display
- FantasticFiction - has data, blocks scraping, no API

### Free search APIs
- Brave Search API - 2k queries/month free, returns snippets from third-party sites (gray area legally)

### LLM options explored
- Groq free tier: 14.4k req/day but org-wide (all users share your limit)
- Local ONNX models: work offline but add 1-3GB to app size
- Claude Code OAuth: promising "bring your own subscription" model but SDK doesn't properly support OAuth tokens yet (returns "Invalid API key")

## Why We're Waiting
Claude Code's OAuth support for third-party SDK usage is buggy. If Anthropic fixes this, users with Claude Pro/Max could use their subscription for LLM-generated descriptions without API key friction.

## What to Check When Revisiting
1. Does Claude Code SDK now support CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN properly?
2. Has Groq changed their rate limit model to per-user?
3. Any new open book APIs with indie coverage?
4. Has Hardcover's API matured with better coverage?
