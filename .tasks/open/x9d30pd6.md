Consider merging Search and Browse into a single unified interface.

**Proposed approach:**
- Tag-free chips (plain text) trigger semantic search against embeddings
- Tag chips (e.g., author:, subject:) filter only the candidates returned by semantic search
- This creates a two-stage pipeline: semantic retrieval -> tag-based filtering

**Benefits:**
- Simpler UI with one view instead of two tabs
- More powerful querying (semantic + faceted filtering combined)
- Progressive refinement of results

**Questions to explore:**
- How to handle the 'no embeddings yet' state?
- Performance implications of two-stage filtering
- UI/UX for chip input (autocomplete for tags?)
