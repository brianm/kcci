Currently only Safari webarchive (.webarchive) format is supported for importing Kindle library. Add support for plain HTML files.

**Motivation:**
- Users may use browsers other than Safari
- HTML is a more universal format (Save Page As... works everywhere)
- Webarchive is Apple-specific binary plist

**Implementation notes:**
- Current parser: src-tauri/src/webarchive.rs (plist-based)
- Will need a new HTML parser, likely using scraper or similar crate
- Same data extraction logic (book titles, ASINs, cover URLs) just different source format
- Consider sharing extraction logic between webarchive and HTML parsers

**Questions:**
- Same Kindle library page structure in saved HTML vs webarchive?
- Should we auto-detect format or have separate import options?
